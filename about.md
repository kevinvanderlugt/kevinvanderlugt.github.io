At the end of 2013, Melanie and I decided to take a year off to travel and upgrade our software development skills.

We were lured by the digital nomad community ...

#### It turned out to **not** be our thing.

We had lots of great experiences but wanted to be in Seattle with friends/family and great teams to work with.

## What do I do?
Since that travel, I have been working as a Sr. iOS Engineer at Rover.com for the past 4 years.

I love to breakdown projects working with PMs and Designers to achieve the best development cost to value ratio.

I really want to help other mobile engineers spend less time debugging and more time building features.


## Whats next?
I am currently building [UserDouble](https://www.userdouble.com)

[UserDouble](https://www.userdouble.com) lets you record and replay user sessions. See every tap, swipe and page view.

## Want to get in touch?
[Email me](mailto:kevin.vanderlugt@gmail.com) if you want to chat about software development, the ups and downs of traveling, or any questions about iOS development.

**Cheers!**

-Kevin
