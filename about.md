I'm currently freelancing and working on personal products while traveling the world.  I love working on difficult projects with clear value and exploring new cultures/food.  This blog is random bits of knowledge that I have gained while working abroad.

At the end of 2013, my wife Melanie and I decided to take a year (or two) off of working from Boeing and Expedia to travel and improve our software development skills. I currently reside in Budapest, Hungary working from our apartment.

I have been doing mobile development for iOS for 5 years and had apps reach in top 10 of the US marketplace twice now.  My applications interact with a backend API that I designed and have run well without updates for almost three years, I am currently working on updating these applications but also taking on client projects.

We are returning to Seattle in May and will be looking for positions available as Ruby or iOS developers.

Cheers!

-Kevin
